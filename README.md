# 🚀 Featured Projects
  - [Information Stealer](https://github.com/saumya103/Information-Stealer.git) : The objective of this project is to develop an Information Stealer that extracts sensitive information such as saved browser passwords, clipboard data, system information, IP resolution using socket, HTTP headers using requests library and also WHOIS information.
  - [PDF Protector and Cracker tool](https://github.com/saumya103/PDF-protector-and-cracker-tool.git) : The objective of this project is to create a Python-based tool that allows users to add password protection to PDF files and crack password-protected PDF files using dictionary-based and brute-force attacks.  
  - [Reverse Shell](https://github.com/saumya103/Reverse-Shell.git) : The goal of this project is to create a reverse shell backdoor using Python. The reverse shell allows remote control of a compromised system by establishing a connection from the victim's machine (client) to an attacker's system (server).
  - [PDF](https://github.com/saumya103/PDF-protector-and-cracker-tool.git) : Simulates and monitor suspicious behavior of a harmless Python "test malware" script such as file creation, process spawning, or registry modification using basic system tools.
